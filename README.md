# HumanFlavoredSoap
A simple Proxy I am making that can be used on HTML. You can deploy in Repl.it, or any web hosting site you want.</br>
I do not know very much about coding and stuff so if anyone is willing to help message me on Discord: Rockpods #1744</br>
SITE LIST:</br>
https://humanflavoredsoap.ga</br>
I am removing support for all sites except main for now. I am doing this so I can focus on updating just one and once I start to get it how I like it so its not updating every five minutes I will open a lot of sites.
<h1>Thanks to Divide and Emerald for helping me.</h1>
